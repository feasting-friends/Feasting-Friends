# Feasting with Friends

Feasting with Friends is a web application that allows users to search and "like" restaurants they've visited, add/follow friends, and view restaurants have liked as well.

The application is using the yelp api to list restaurants and integrates algolia and caching to provide instant search and autofill.

## Getting Started:

1. Download the repository to your local machine

2. Use npm i to install dependencies

3. Use npm run dev to start the development server
